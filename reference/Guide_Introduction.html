<h3>What is Energia?</h3>
<p>Energia is an Open Souce, free to use IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that is used to write programs for microcontrollers. It is its own community with no affiliation with any corporate entities. While the Energia community has a great relationship with Texas Instruments, it is completely seperate and independent.
</p>
<p class='vspace'></p><p>The Energia programming language is a fork of the Arduino programming language, an implementation of Wiring, a similar physical computing platform, which is based on the Processing multimedia programming environment.
</p>
<h3>What is LaunchPad?</h3>
<p>LaunchPads are low-cost kits made by Texas Instruments that provide developers with everything they need to start designing new applications.  They can act as smaller computers that can sense and control more of the physical world than your desktop computer using electronic sensors. This is usually refered to as embedded processing. It's a physical computing platform based on a microcontroller board, and a development environment for writing software for the board.
</p>
<p class='vspace'></p><p>LaunchPad can be used to develop interactive objects, taking inputs from a variety of switches or sensors, and controlling a variety of lights, motors, and other physical outputs. LaunchPad projects can be stand-alone (only run on the Target Board, i.e. your LaunchPad), or they can be communicate with software running on your computer (Host PC). The boards are purchased pre-assembled and ready to go out of the box; the open-source Energia IDE can be downloaded for free.  TI also offers additional free tools to LaunchPad customers.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>
<p> More information about LaunchPad can be found on the TI site: <a class='urllink' href='http://www.ti.com/launchpad'>www.ti.com/launchpad</a>
</p>
<p class='vspace'></p><h3>Why Energia + LaunchPad?</h3>
<p>There are many other microcontrollers and microcontroller platforms available for physical computing. Arduino, Freescale, Parallax Basic Stamp, Netmedia's BX-24, Phidgets, MIT's Handyboard, and many others offer similar functionality. All of these tools take the messy details of microcontroller programming and wrap it up in an easy-to-use package.   Energia also simplifies the process of working with microcontrollers, but it offers some advantage for teachers, students, and interested amateurs over other systems:
</p>
<p class='vspace'></p><ul><li>Inexpensive - LaunchPad boards are very inexpensive compared to other microcontroller platforms.  They come ready to roll right out of the box.
<p class='vspace'></p></li><li>Cross-platform - The Energia software runs on Windows, Macintosh OSX, and Linux operating systems. Most microcontroller systems are limited to Windows.
<p class='vspace'></p></li><li>Simple, clear programming environment - The Energia programming environment is easy-to-use for beginners, yet flexible enough for advanced users to take advantage of as well. For teachers, it's conveniently based on the Processing programming environment, so students learning to program in that environment will be familiar with the look and feel of Energia.
<p class='vspace'></p></li><li>Open source and extensible software- The Energia software is published as open source tools, available for extension by experienced programmers.  The language can be expanded through C++ libraries, and people wanting to understand the technical details can make the leap from Energia to the C/C++ programming language on which it's based. <span class='wikiword'>Similarly</span>, you can add C/C++ code directly into your Energia programs if you want to.
<p class='vspace'></p></li><li>Well supported hardware - The LaunchPad is based on Texas Instruments microcontrollers.  TI provides full documentation and support to customers and is actively improving the LaunchPad ecosystem.
